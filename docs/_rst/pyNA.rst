pyna
====

The pyna class contains the methods to run the following noise analyses:
	* Computing noise contours from a list of microhpone locations
	* Computing the EPNL table for the individual and overall noise sources
	* Computing noise directional and spectral distributions
	* Computing noise for a predefined trajectory time series
	* Computing a take-off trajectory
	* Computing a take-off trajectory and its noise 
The class also contains methods to plot the results of these analyses.
