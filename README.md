**pyNA** is the *python Noise Assessment* tool to assess the noise footprint of aircraft engines. The tool estimates the mean-square acoustic pressure level for different engine noise sources, propagates the source noise to an observer on the ground and calculates the noise levels as defined in ICAO Annex 16 Environmental Protection, Volume I: Aircraft Noise.


A detailed documentation of **pyNA** can be found here: [https://github.mit.edu/pages/lvoet/pyNA/](https://github.mit.edu/pages/lvoet/pyNA/)
